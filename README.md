## About The Project

Considering the fact that there are many such industries (Textile, Diamond, Mining, Labour, etc.) in which analytical metrics may not be available through direct sources and that makes deciding for appraisals and promotions tough.

The corporates who have got better thinkers in their management structure are performing far better than their competitors.

Feedesto provides a Complete and Concrete solution to help executives in the decision making process for promotions or appraisals of the employees through anonymous discussions and feedback.
